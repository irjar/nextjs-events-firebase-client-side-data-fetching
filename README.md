This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The app allows to browse events, select a single event and filter for events. There is an events page, the user can explore individual events and filter them by selecting the year and month filters, the app uses dummy back end on Firebase so the dummy data can be fetched from there.
